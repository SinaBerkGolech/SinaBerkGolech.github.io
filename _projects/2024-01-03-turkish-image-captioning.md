## Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge of automatic image captioning in Turkish, a language with different linguistic characteristics compared to English. The work extends the MS COCO dataset with Turkish captions and evaluates state-of-the-art models.

## Key Features

- **Turkish MS COCO Dataset**: Extended dataset with Turkish language captions
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implementation of transformer-based architectures
- **Multilingual NLP**: Natural language processing for Turkish language
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive benchmarking of captioning models

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Transformers
- Computer Vision libraries
- Natural Language Processing tools

## Research Impact

This work achieved state-of-the-art performance for Turkish image captioning with a Bleu-1 score of 0.72 using Meshed Memory Transformers. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for Turkish NLP research and machine translation studies.

## Publication

This work has been published in the 2022 International Conference on Electrical, Computer, Communications and Mechatronics Engineering (ICECCME).
